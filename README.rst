The pySTEPS initiative is a community that develops and maintains an easy to 
use, modular, free and open source python framework for short-term ensemble 
prediction systems.

The focus is on probabilistic nowcasting of radar precipitation fields,
but pySTEPS is designed to allow a wider range of uses.
